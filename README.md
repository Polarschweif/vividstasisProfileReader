This program will detect and display your data from vivid/stasis with a quick overview of your Points, Battery, Rating and even your Soundscan Boosttickets.
It can also be useful for an obs-scene by turning the background green.
Simply click anywhere on the black/green area to toggle between black and green.

Future Ideas
------------------------------------
 - Re-adding a 2nd tab page with all the informations and still being able to toggle background color between black and green.
 - Being able to customize the QuickOverview page.
 - Being able to display achievements on a 3rd tab page.
 - Adding Achievement progression on the QuickOverwiev page.
