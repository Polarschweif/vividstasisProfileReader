# Behind the scenes
**(basically just a logwhere I put anything like funny or interesting stuff in that happened to me while coding)**

## The Idea

The Idea came out of nowhere, I was just looking into the vivid/stadis
profile data and had the Idea *what if I just let a program read them in a
quick overvier* and **BAM**, 30 minutes later I finished the first prototype of
this whole project.


## Everything before 1.5.7

So, everything started with just a window, a few panels and labels
displaying the stats. It was just black background, the panels as background
for every stat and the labels displaying the stats. This was the
first prototype. Later on made some improvements for coding so I can easily
add and remove the stats and also give them a better name than just the raw
stuff like *money* instead of *Points*.

With the version 1.1 I added the achievements display. I wanted to
have a little bit of the vivid/stasis theme on the self made progressbar.
It went pretty well but I somehow have 48/47 achievements. I think an achievement
got deleted but remained in the profile file, but I am not sure.
This was also the point where I knew, that this project will get **way**
bigger than I thought.

With the version of 1.2, also known as the QOL-Update, I added a context menu
(wich also got an update later on) wich allows you to toggle the visibility
of the stats to decide wether to show specific stats or not and you can
choose the background color of the stats panel and its text individually.
But it didn't really take long to do it so it was nothing too big to make.

The biggest update was 1.3 wich added the Keyoverlay and its KPS (Keys per
second) live stats. It has counters for every single key and the programm will
read the bindings from vivid/stasis. It temporarily had the average KPS display
but got removed later on because it would also count when you would be Idle.
I'll work on it and would re-added maybe with 1.7 or 1.8. Am thinking of
that when the user is idle (so KPS = 0) the program wouldnt include it in the
calculation. I wanted it to release the KPS stats with the overlay itself but
forgot it somehow so it got added later.

After a few minor updates, 1.4 released including starfall's random song picker,
wichcis basically a website. It took me a bit of time to understand how I can
run an internal browser wich can do inputs on the website and can read the
result and display it. And since EmK530 made Livecross and its website, I am
thinking about doing similar stuff to it like the random song picker. (Both
of them need a big shoutout) I also made that the contextmenu wont disappear
when toggeling stuff and added help.pdf wich can either be opened via the
program or in the explorer. I might change stuff on that but like later on,
maybe in 1.9 or so.

then last but not least 1.5 wich is an importand update since the window is now
able to be smaller or bigger depending on the screen aspect ratio (or sum shi
like that, my english sucks sometimes) but thats pretty much it for 1.5.
