# Behind the scenes
**(basically just a logwhere I put anything like funny or interesting stuff in that happened to me while coding)

## The Idea

The Idea came out of nowhere, I was just looking into the vivid/stadis
profile data and had the Idea *what if I just let a program read them in a
quick overvier* and **BAM**, 30 minutes later I finished the first prototype of
this whole project.


## Everything before 1.5.7

So, everything started with just a window, a few panels and labels
displaying the stats. It was just black background, the panels as background
for every stat and the labels displaying the stats. This was the
first prototype. Later on made some improvements for coding so I can easily
add and remove the stats and also give them a better name than just the raw
stuff like *money* instead of *Points*.
With the version 1.2 I added the achievements display.
